Bugs found by me(Abhishek Kumar){
(* 	edit profile not working *)
(* 	footer is playing hide and seek *)
(* 	header dropdown not working on invite_page *)
(*	if logged in a user should not be able to open signup_page *)
(* 	if logged in a user should not be able to open signup_page *)
	after editing my post on edit_post_page, submitting throws an error (DATE TIME FORMAT FIXING, VINODH is DOING THAT)
(* 	@iphone there are no checks on post_form for total_seats, car_type , when submitting without changing these values throws server error *)

	sugestions:
		post_page different icon/photo for each entry, same ones create confusion (BTW dummy profile photo is great!!)
		on post_form cost_per_seat field Rs should be written on the right hand side.
		an additional check before cancel post

	question:
(* 		I could not delete a trip that has started. When will it get deleted?? After an hour *)
